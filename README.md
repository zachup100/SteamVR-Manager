# SteamVR Manager
 
SteamVR Manager is meant to be a quick-tool for enabling or disabling SteamVR. Useful to prevent it from auto-launching along side VR supported programs (VRChat, ROBLOX, Boneworks, etc).
This is my first C# Windows Forms as I am a noob at it, so please expect some issues depending on your Operating System. I will try my best to fix any issues that, or implement any new features.
